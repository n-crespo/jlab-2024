# Objectives

As parts make their way around the SRF Test Lab, they go through various stages, or actions, at different locations, or work centers. At each step, an engineer is tasked with creating a Traveler for the part they are dealing with. To streamline the creation of travelers into the Pansophy system and minimize errors due to typos, it is in Jefferson Labâ€™s best interest to automate the entrance of part information as much as possible. As such, unique bar codes have been placed on most parts with stickers. These barcodes, which produce Transaction IDs, can prove various important characteristics of a part. Combined with location information stored in cookies that is pre-set on every engineer's machine, a proper implementation will instantly redirect an engineer to a Traveler page with just on scan of a barcode.
