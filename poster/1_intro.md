# Introduction

The superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities that line the linear particle accelerator at Jefferson Lab allow for near zero energy loss and enable particles to travel at close to the speed of light. However, the highly specialized nature of SRF technology means Jefferson Lab must design, construct and test SRF cavities in house. Though this allows the Lab to produce cavities for accelerator facilities around the world, it also presents an exceedingly difficult challenge in the area of inventory and data management. Pansophy, an internal data management system is a all-encompassing solution to this problem.

The automation of data entry and collection in the Pansophy system is crucial for minimizing human error.

aid in SRF cavity construction for sister accelerator facilities, it also produces an exceedingly difficult challenge in inventory and information management as parts frequently move in, out and around Jefferson Lab.
