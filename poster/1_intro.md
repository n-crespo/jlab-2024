In order to accelerate particles to the highest possible energy, Jefferson Lab
utilizes superconducting radio frequency (SRF) technologies. SRF cavities and
cryomodules are designed and constructed out of Niobium in the SRF department
and line the linear portions of the accelerator to allow particles to travel at
near light speed.
