One of the most integral aspects of the particle accelerator at Jefferson Lab
(JLab) is the ability to design, construct, and test of superconducting Niobium
cavities to ensure minimal energy loss.

At Jefferson Lab (JLab), the Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) Lab is
responsible for the design, construction, and testing of superconducting Niobium
cavities that are crucial to the **function** of the particle accelerator.
